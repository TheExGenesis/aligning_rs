Santos, Feb 2006, Evolutionary dynamics of social dilemmas in structured heterogeneous populations

- Evolutionary Game Theory.

- Users have strategies that evolve
- A generation has all pairs of individuals interact in a game, payoffs are accumulated.
- At the end of a generation, a user compares its accumulated payoff to that of a random neighbor and has a proportional probability of switching to the other's strategy.
- Scale-free networks
- All cooperation dilemmas
