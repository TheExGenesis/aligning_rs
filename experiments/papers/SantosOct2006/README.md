Santos, Oct 2006, Cooperation Prevails When Individuals Adjust Their Social Ties

- Like SantosFeb2006, but with rewiring
- Evolutionary Game Theory.
- Users have strategies that evolve
- A generation has all pairs of individuals interact in a game, payoffs are accumulated.
- Evolution: At the end of a generation, a user compares its accumulated payoff to that of a random neighbor and has a proportional probability of switching to the other's strategy.
- Rewiring: At the end of a generation, a user defected upon may rewire to a neighbor of a random neighbor
- Evolution and Rewiring happen at a proportion W, the time-scale ratio.
- Starting with random networks leads to Scale-free networks
- All cooperation dilemmas
